# Basic-Python-Projects

This git repository contains all the python projects that I created during the time I learned the basics of the python. This repository contains the projects that implements the python OOP concepts and basic concepts such as datatypes, variables, functions, modules and many more. The projects are the part of my learning from Dr. Angela yu's 100 Days of Code course which is available on udemy, However I have made sure to add some modifications to the projects.
